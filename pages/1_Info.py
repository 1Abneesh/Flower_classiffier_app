1. Launch the app: 
    To launch the app, run the script that contains your Streamlit code. This will start a local web server and open the app in a browser.

2. Select an image: 
    In the app, you should have a button or file uploader that allows the user to select an image of a flower. Click the button or select an image from your device to upload it to the app.

3. Select a pretrained CNN model: 
    Before making a prediction, you can select from a list of pretrained CNN models. Choose the model that you want to use to make the prediction.

4. Wait for the prediction: 
    After the image and model are selected, the app will perform the necessary computations and make a prediction about the species of the flower in the image. This may take a few seconds, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the image.

5. View the prediction: 
    The app will display the prediction results, including the top prediction for the species of the flower and its probability.

6. Repeat the process: 
    If you want to classify another flower species, you can repeat the steps 2-5 to get a prediction for a new image.

**Note:** The app's accuracy is greater than 75%, but there may still be some errors in the predictions. Always verify the predictions with additional sources before taking any action based on them.
